# RGBvalues

Prompt:
1.	Write a program that will read an image and form 3 new images:
a.	Keep the top left quadrant of the original image.
b.	The center of the image.
c.	Reverse the original image

2.	Write an image processing function called frequencyRGB. The functions displays the Frequency distribution of pixels in R, G and B as a 
a.	bar Graph for each R, G, and B.

This program takes an input .ppm image (labeled input.ppm).
It will output output_1.ppm, output_2.ppm, and output_3.ppm. These correspond to the above prompt.
It will then output bargraph.ppm which outputs the frequencies of all R, G, and B values as a bar graph in each colors' respective color. 

I added the input image I used as well as the outputs I recieve after running my program.
